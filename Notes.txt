- A way of organizing data to be used efficiently.

- Linear: Elements form a sequence or a linear list. (Array, Linked List, Stacks, Queues)
- Non-Linear: Traversal of nodes is nonlinear in nature. (Graph and Trees)

Various operations that can be performed on data structures:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching
- Sorting

Array vs Linked-List:
- Arrays have fixed size; Linked lists are dynamic!
- Inserting and Deleting a new element in an array is expensive.
- Random access not allowed in a Linked List
- Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of a Linked List
- Arrays have better cache locality

Stack:
- Linear data structure that can be used as LIFO or FILO.
	- Push, Pop, Peek

Queue vs Stack:
- Queue is linear that follows FIFO.
	- Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear
- Difference is via Removal.
	- In a stack, we remove the most recently added.
	- In a queue, we remove the item least recently added.

Infix, Prefix, Postfix Notation:
- Infix Notation("Normal Notation") - Operators between operands
	- (X + Y) (A * (B + C) / D)
- Postfix Notation ("Reverse Polish Notation") - Operators after operand
	- (X Y +) (A B C + * D/)
- Prefix Notation ("Polish Notation") - Operators before operands
	- (+ X Y) (/ * A + B C D)

Linked List:
- A linear data structure such as an array, where each element is a seperate object. Each element (Node), has the Data and a reference to the next node.
	- Singly Linked List: Every node stores address or reference to next node and the last node is NULL.
	- Doubly Linked List: Every node stores Data, and reference points to next and previous one.
	- Circular Linked List: All nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL.

BFS vs DFS: (Breadth First vs Depth First Traversal)
- Queue is used for BFS
- Stack is used for DFS (or Recursion)


Semaphore: A variable used to achieve process syncronization in a multi processing environment
Deadlock: Where processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another to be acquired.
